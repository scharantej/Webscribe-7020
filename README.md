### HTML Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the application. It will have a form with two text boxes, a submit button, and a display area for the result.
- **results.html**: This HTML file is not mandatory, but it can be used to display the result of the form submission. It can include the text entered in the text boxes and any additional information generated by the application.

### Routes

- **home**: This route will be mapped to the '/' URL and will handle the display of the index.html file.
- **submit**: This route will be mapped to '/submit' URL and will handle the form submission. It will receive the data from the text boxes and process it to generate the result. The result can be displayed by redirecting to the 'results.html' or by returning the result as a JSON response.

### Flask Application

```
from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    text1 = request.form.get('text1')
    text2 = request.form.get('text2')
    
    # Process the text and generate the result

    return render_template('results.html', result=result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```
